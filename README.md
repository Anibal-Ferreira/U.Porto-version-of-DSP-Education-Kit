# U.Porto-version-of-DSP-Education-Kit
This is an adaptation of the original [ARM University DSP Education Kit](https://github.com/arm-university/Digital-Signal-Processing-Education-Kit) to serve the specificities of an undergraduate signal processing course at the University of Porto - Faculty of Engineering. Our course (called Fundamentals of Signal Processing) had its first edition in 2021/2022, and is structured as a combination of three types of classes: lectures (1.5 h/week), applied theory (1.5 h/week), and labs (1 h/week). Although this arrangement may change in the near future, the [current course syllabus](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=485397) and the rather short duration of lab classes recommend an adapted version of the original ARM lab materials so that students can address in the lab a few key experiments and associated questions whcih are subject to grading.  
We describe next what the focus is in each lab and how it relates to the orginal ARM lab materials.

**Lab Summary:** Getting started with the DSP Education kit: LUT-based Real-Time Sine Wave Generation), Basic Analogue Input & Output Using the STM32F746G Disco Board, and Delaying the Signal.

This first DSP lab consists of a simplified version of the original ARM “LAB 1 Analog Input and Output” that is included in the original ARM Module_1/Lab/IntroductionLab folder. It assumes that all the installation steps that are specified in the original ARM “DSP_Getting_Started_Guide.docx” have been followed through and successfully completed. In our case, before the start of lab classes, all lab PCs have been configured according to the instructions in the original ARM “DSP_Getting_Started_Guide.docx”.
