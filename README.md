# U.Porto-version-of-DSP-Education-Kit
This is an adaptation of the original [ARM University DSP Education Kit](https://github.com/arm-university/Digital-Signal-Processing-Education-Kit) to serve the specificities of an undergraduate signal processing course at the University of Porto - Faculty of Engineering. Our course (called Fundamentals of Signal Processing) had its first edition in 2021/2022, and is structured as a combination of three types of classes: lectures (1.5 h/week), applied theory (1.5 h/week), and labs (1 h/week). Although this arrangement may change in the near future, the [current course syllabus](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=485397) and the rather short duration of lab classes recommend an adapted version of the original ARM lab materials so that students can address in the lab a few key experiments and associated questions whcih are subject to grading.  
We describe next what the focus is in each lab and how it relates to the orginal ARM lab materials.
